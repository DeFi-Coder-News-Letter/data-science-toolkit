    "# Time Series Forecasting with Prophet \n",

    "## Mini-Vignette: Modeling the Price of Ethereum\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is Prophet?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) is an open source package (for both Python and R) for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit wth yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well (according to the pcakage documentation). Prophet is open source software released by Facebook's core Data Science team. It is [available for download](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/installation.html) on CRAN and PyPI. The academic paper (still in peer-review at the time of this writing) [is available here](https://peerj.com/preprints/3190/). \n",
    "\n",
    "tl;dr --> Prophet is essentially Facebook's data science team's version of [auto-ARIMA](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/08/auto-arima-time-series-modeling-python-r/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case: Understanding Seasonal & Temporal Patterns in the Price of Ethereum\n",
    "\n",
    "Prophet is particularly well-suited for a use case like examining the [daily price of ETH](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/) (aka Ether)--the 2nd largest cryptoasset [after Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UBk1e5qnr4)--as we have multiple years of daily data, and we suppose that there may be seasonal effects at various levels of granularity that moderate price movement in some way. The motivation for this vignette came from some of [my other work examining price movements in the crypto markets](https://github.com/pmaji/crypto-whale-watching-app), in which I observed many traders claiming that there was a discernable \"weekend bump\" or \"weekend bull\" effect in crypto markets. To summarize, **there have been many claims that weekends are, *ceteris paribus*, more bullish for ETH trading than weekdays. This methodology will enable us to test the veracity of such claims.** While in this vignette I will build a \"forecast\" for the price of ETH, the main goal of this vignette is not to arrive at a perfect price forecast. Instead, the goal is to make use of the explanatory capabilities built into the Prophet package to look for evidence that may either support or contradict the 'weekend bull' thesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "This vignette doesn't fully exlore anywhere near all of the features of Prophet, and is only meant as an introduction. Hopefully you are inspired by what you see below to think of ways to improve this work, perhaps applying it to other time series forecasting applications as well. I am by no means an expert (either of Prophet specifically, or time-series forecasting writ large), but if you have any questions, feel free to [open an issue here on GitHub](https://github.com/pmaji/data-science-toolkit/issues), and, as always, I'll do my best to respond expeditiously. With that, let's get into the code!\n",

    "## Pulling Historical Price Data for Ethereum\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plenty ways that one can access historical OHLC data for top cryptocurrencies. If you're interested in data science projects pertaining to cryptocurrencies and/or how to access pertinent crypto data specifically, I highly recommend checking out two other public projects I maintain that deal in the crypto space:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [This one here](https://github.com/pmaji/financial-asset-comparison-tool/blob/master/README.md) is a Python app that tracks \"whale\" (aka large volume) activity in US crypto markets\n",
    "    - This project pulls OHLC crypto data from [Coin Metrics](https://coinmetrics.io/)\n",
    "- [This one here](https://github.com/pmaji/crypto-whale-watching-app) is an R Shiny app that allows for the comparison of the performance of traditional financial assets vs. cryptos\n",
    "    - This project pulls OHLC crypto data [from GDAX's (aka Coinbase Pro's) API](https://docs.pro.coinbase.com/?r=1)\n",
    "    \n",
    "That said, for this vignette, I decided to use the very simple and user-friendly [package \"cryptory\"](https://github.com/dashee87/cryptory) to pull in OHLC data for ETH (sourced from CoinMarketCap). Why ETH... why not Bitcoin or insert-other-cryptocurrency-here? I chose ETH simply because it's the project and community in which I am most personally interested and involved. If you want to see what a forecast for another cryptoasset would look like, simply fork this repo, change one line of code in this notebook, and if you discover something cool, let me know (my twitter is hyperlinked above in the byline)!"

    "From the above we can see that we have some pretty clean data to work with.

If you're interested in one that would look like, you can see that at work in a recent [vignette I wrote up on radar charts here](https://github.com/pmaji/data-science-toolkit/blob/master/eda-and-visualization/radar_charts.ipynb). \n",
