# r-stats-playground

Welcome! This is a new repository dedicated to all things related to statistical modeling in R. 

Presently, I am working through the ISLR; hence, I'll keep my rough notes here as I progress. My goal is to build this into a compilation of reference material--from basic notes on various techniques to more complicated, longer for examples--on a variet of modeling techniques in R.
