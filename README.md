# stats-playground

Welcome! This is the repository that I will use to build out my stockpile of statistical methods and modeling techniques. I began my self-teaching of all things modeling-related with the ISLR, and I have included some of my notes and practice code from those readings and videos under the "ISLR" folder.

After going through the entire ISLR, I wanted to jump into some deeper-dives into particular modeling techniques. I began with classification techniques, and in each folder--for example /r-stats-and-modeling/classifcation/logit--click on the .md file to read the rendered markdown document that will display all relevant code and output.

Finally, I have collected some useful custom functions for tests and visualizations into a series of scripts that can be sourced like a package, and this can be found at /r-stats-and-modeling/classifcation/useful_classification_functions.R

I welcome all feedback and contributions to this codebase as I seek to build this out further! Don't hesitate to contact me via the opening of an Issue in the tab above.
