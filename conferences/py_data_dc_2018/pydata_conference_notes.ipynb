    "# PyData DC Conference\n",
    "Friday November 16th, 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi there! The notes below are my scribblings from my time at the Friday tutorial portion of the [2018 DC PyData Conference,](https://pydata.org/dc2018/) hosted at Capital One's HQ in McLean, VA. There were 4 timeslots for sessions peppered throughout the day, with 2 sessions from which to choose during each timeslot. As such, I was only able to attend 4/8 total sessions. For the complete schedule (so you can see what I missed) check out the [full schedule for the day here](https://pydata.org/dc2018/schedule/). If you are reading this and you were able to attend some of the sessions not covered below, feel free to reach out via the Issues tab above so that any notes you took may can be itegrated as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend reading this write-up about the conference once-through, and thereafter jumping to the different notebooks, files, and folders I mention throughout for more information about particular sessions. In some cases, the particular session came with a notebook pre-populated with all the code needed to follow along, whereas in other cases, the code was all done on the fly. In either case, I include links to all pertinent content under the corresponding subsections below, and in many cases have added my own alterations / notes to the content presented. This is almost always to clarify something in the code, fix a problem that came up during the live demo, or simply take note of something helpful that was said during the session but not included in the code or mentioned in the comments (if any were provided). \n",
    "\n",
    "All credit goes the original presenters--it was a great conference--enjoy!"
