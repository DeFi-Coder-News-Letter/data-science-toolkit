    "# Appending Many HTML Files Into One in Python (w/ BeautifulSoup)\n",
    "\n",
    "By: [Paul Jeffries](https://twitter.com/ByPaulJ) \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this example, all I did was append two copies of the example HTML document [from R Studio's website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html)--which happens to be a [series of vignettes involving charts made by the NYT](http://timelyportfolio.github.io/rCharts_nyt_home_price/). That said, in practice this code, or an adaptation thereof, might prove helpful wherever you need to go from many .html files to one. This might be compiling, for example, many .html files that were output by an RMarkdown-centric process, where the use of Bookdown was not feasible. The benefit of this kind of process as opposed to a unix scripting solution or some other alternative is that if you have a table of contents, this process will preserve it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever your desired use case, I hope you find this code helpful or informative in some way!"
